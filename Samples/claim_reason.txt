Moving on, we calculate the average median income of housing in the table, which is [3.848989933333329] (units unspecified). Now, we can address the question of whether the average median income of housing in the table is greater than 200000 (units unspecified). Considering that the average median income is 3.848989933333329, we can conclude that it is not greater than 200000, as 3.848989933333329 is less than 200000. However, it's important to note that the units of measurement are not specified, which could affect the interpretation of these figures."
